### Mom Needs An App

Having completed UCB bootcamp in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak, my poor 3rd grade teaching mother has been inundated with zoom meetings and phonecalls from parents and needs a way to schedule blocks to meet with parents and teachers to regain some semblance of her old working scheudle. We have here my first attempt at that. Starting from scratch and applying what I've learned during the last several months, I'll try to make something my mom actually uses.

Minimum Viable Product:
1. Have a login system for my mom.
2. Have a login system for parents.
3. Have a scheduling system for parents to create appointments with mom.
